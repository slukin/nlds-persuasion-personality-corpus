1,5,evolution,5,74947,75019,6078,123,3569,"1. Carbon dating is not accurate.
2. Do a search on google and you'll find the information pertaining to the universities in question.
3. ""Natural selection"" is not a ""force"" behind evolution.
You do not have to believe in creationism, however, trying to convince people that your opinions are correct when they're based upon an unfounded theory is ludicrous!
You can theorise all you want but, in the end, it is all pure speculation.
As for the exact age of the earth being recorded in the bible, that's not true. The bible has recorded and predicted many events. Those who read it try to work out how old the earth is. But no where does it give an exact age - that is mere speculation, too.
http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs...bon_dating.asp
","A statement based on ignorance. Carbon dating is quite accurate. Some years ago it was accurately calibrated back about 11,000 years using dendrochronology. Prior to 11,000 years the error bars on dates became larger and larger. However, in 1998 carbon dating was calibrated back to about 45,000 years, essentially the entire useful life of the technique.
Here's how it was done. Sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Suigetsu in Japan were taken. The bottom of this lake is characterized by alternating light and dark layers - these are known as varves and one light and one dark layer is deposited each year, depending on the season. You see, the light layer is caused by the annual algae bloom. As the algae die, they settle on the bottom and form the light layer. The dark layer is made up of clay that settles as silt on the bottom during the winter. That this is true is a matter of observation - the varves are still being deposited each year and there is no discontinuity in the core that indicates that it has been otherwise in the past.
At any rate, the varves were carefully counted back to about 45,000 years ago. Samples of known age were carbon dated. Thus, by comparing the apparent age of a carbon dated sample to the actual age counted from the varves, the technique of carbon dating was calibrated for essentially its whole useful range.
You were aware, weren't you, that radio-carbon can only be detected for about 50,000 years? With more sensative instrumentation it has been detected in samples thought to be about 70,000 years old, but it isn't useful for age dating.
I don't understand why it is that if carbon dating were not useful it would matter to evolutionary theory. Does this mean that the carbon dating used by archaeologists to date artifacts in the Holy Land are wrong? Does this mean that the Dead Sea Scrolls aren't about 2,000 years old? If carbon dating is unreliable, I don't understand why Biblical scholars would make such extensive use of in in attempting to support the Bible.
I'm unclear what you are talking about.
Not sure what you mean. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations. Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics. There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity, and, of course, there are mechanisms that tend to increase it.
Those who refer to scientific theory as unfounded only make themselves look ignorant. In science, the word theory means that it has been tested. For example, there is the theory that the earth is a sphere. There is the theory that the planets orbit the sun. There is the theory that matter is made up of atoms and that the atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. There is the theory that by striking certain isotopes of uranium with high energy neutrons that the nucleus will split and release energy.
It seems strange to hear someone claim that it is speculation that the sun is at the center of the solar system. I guess it is also speculation that germs cause disease. It seems funny that ships of the Navy would put nuclear reactors in ships based on mere speculation that they can get power out of them, or speculation that they won't explode.

2,5,evolution,4.6,15221,15254,4569,123,5306,"What is evolution?
This is quite a funny post! Such a vacuous attempt at a sales pitch... let's all get comfy with evolution!
""A theory is a good theory when there is no evidence to disprove the theory and the theory makes good and useful predictions. Evolution does this.""
""What are the predictions made by evolution.""
Well, we can find oil (!) and test cosmetics on animals (!) I wasn't sure if this was meant to be funny or not. Did they not find oil before evolution? Would they not be able to tell that oil exists next to certain rocks without evolution? Why bring in animal testing? If you want to stake a claim that such cruel behaviour is part of evolution, hey, that's up to you (takes a bit of heat off us Christians over the Crusades!) (ha!)
""First and most important was when the theory was in it?s infancy, it was predicted that a mechanism would be found that would pass along characteristics from generation to generation. It took at least a hundred years but sure enough DNA and genes were found. One of the hottest areas in science is genetics with hundreds of millions of dollars being invested This along with many other predictions makes evolution a good theory""
Really, you've hit the jackpot with this one, because www.talkorigins.com claims that the 'mechanism' is still unknown... at least how the 'mechanism' works to produce macroevolution. Perhaps you should write to them!
""An acquaintance who was an oil company geologist made this statement. ?Oil companies spend millions on evolutionary geologists to find oil and not one cent on creationist geologists. Again, predictions that make evolution a good theory.""
Yes, that is an amazing statement folks. The oil companies actively weed-out geologists who are creationists, because they've been looking for oil in all the wrong places (!) (at least that's what I assume this quote means).
""Where is evolution used outside of Biology, Geology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Embryology, and Genetics""
That's right, many of these sciences didn't exist before evolution (certainly not the first three!) (Ouch!)
""Evolutionary algorithms have been used for a number of years to design computer programs. One of the latest developments is designing electronic circuits using evolution. What is done is to start with a random design and create a population of these circuits. For the next generation, a random variation is introduced in a small subset of the population. Those that were most suitable for the job were selected and mated with some of the unmutated circuits. The next generation was still not near desired result but the process but the process continued. Each generation is closer to the desired result. After 5000 generations a working circuit was developed that even the designers did not understand how it worked. some of these circuit have received patents. You can read more about this at http://www.genetic-programming.com. As you can see the theory of evolution works in fields outside its primary field, this makes this a great theory.""
Can I restate this again... 'designing electronic circuits' ... design implies intelligence. And look, after 5000 generations we get what? A cyborg super-intelligence? Nope!
""The next time you hear someone say, ""When you see a computer (any manufactured item) you know it was designed"", you can now say it may have been designed using evolution.""
Yes, I can say that. I'll do that tomorrow at work! (ha!)
But seriously, evolution is a theory of explaining an apparent change in animals. It is not the change in animals... because that has not been proven!
","Actually, no they could not find oil without evolution. It's not only a matter of finding ""certain rocks"" associated with oil, but by reconstructing the paleo-environment. Only certain environments, indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time, are suitable for the production of petroleum.
In fact, a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology. Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places.

The death penalty (because of appeals) costs more than solitary confinement for life, both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again. Also I have the same question for drug users, gamblers, etc. Why make society pay to imprison them when all they are doing is hurt themselves?","Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times. The lowest estimate of the yearly cost for imprisoning somebody is around $22,000. The average amount of time a prisoner spends imprisoned after getting a life sentence is 60 years. Take into account the cost of building jails in order to house all these prisoners and you up the amount even more. After the average of 60 years for a life sentence, tax payers have spent $1,320,000 on ONE SINGLE PERSON. Imagine what this money could do in the education system? You said yourself, the only thing that may push the cost of the death penalty over life imprisonment is the ridiculous amount of appeals that are given. If only one appeal was given before the sentence was final, it would be far cheaper to exectue somebody than imprison them for life. How many times does a person need to prove their innocence?

3,3,climate change,3,332443,332447,11942,4F,-1,"Global warming is nothing more than a myth that was cooked up by nature freaks who're against anything industrialized.
 
 And if that isn't true, then I don't care; we've already done far too much damage for any difference to be made now.","Hi NATO, I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all. Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.
 
 But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.
 
 So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet, since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim."

","There are lot's of things that conduct electricity to some degree or another.
Polysilanes, for just one example, has a backbone of -Si-Si-Si-, and conducts because the sigma orbitals of Si are diffuse enough to overlap.
It's this de-localization of electrons that allows for conductivity.
If a carbon polymer has a lot of double/triple bonds or benzene rings then it should conduct.
Just like graphite, which is much more conductive along the a and b axes (the axes where the graphene planes lie) because of all the electronic delocalization.
But it's a poor conductor along the c-axis, because there are only weak pi-pi interactions and little orbital overlap.
Sulfur, I suppose would be a poor candidate for the basis of life.
The only times it forms more than two bonds is if it is bonded to a very electronegative atom like oxygen or fluorine. Also, it does not catenate very easily, and if it did, it would just be a chain of sulfur (no longer than 8 atoms long) with practically no functionality.

The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection. The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways. One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group. Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point.
None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect. Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects!

 But the court left it to the Legislature to determine whether the state will honor gay marriage or some other form of civil union.
 
 Advocates on both sides of the issue believed the state posed the best chance for gay marriage to win approval since Massachusetts became the only state to do so in 2003 because the New Jersey Supreme Court has a history of extending civil rights protections.
 
 Instead, the high court stopped short of fully approving gay marriage and gave lawmakers 180 days to rewrite marriage laws to either include gay couples or create new civil unions. (Opinion -- pdfexternal link)

 Mind you he 'walked' 3 times.. all of which I was there to witness. I was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. Back to the drawing table.. Last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his IQ test. The limit for the death penalty is 70. He was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. So now he is off death row, and the DA has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty. I have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. I do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say I am too close to the matter. But I did feel let down when they took him off death row, now I feel like there will never be justice. I put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as I dreaded witnessing it, I also looked forward to it.
 I do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful....
 but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be I should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure I could do it.

The term Marriage appears 41 times in the NIV (New International Version). The term Marry appears 42 times in the NIV. But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation don't want to consider at all. For example, here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled. 
 
 Hbr 13:4 Marriage {is to be held} in honor among all, and the {marriage} bed {is to be} undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
 And here is where God consecrated the relationship (Marriage) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve. He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time. 
 
 No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world, homosexuals included. Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal.
 Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them(Adam and Eve), and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'Exd 22:19 'Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.
 Sex with animals was once a death penalty offense. Today, we have web sites promoting it.
 
 Lev. 20:13 ''If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
 
 ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their 
 women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
 
 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
 
 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things 
 deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also 
 approve of those who practice them.
 
 Now all one must do to rationally determine that God, through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality. If God considers homosexuality so unnatural an act and a death penalty offense under the OT Law, do you really believe that He thinks gay marriage is right, acceptable or normal?"
7,3,climate change,-3,363621,363638,5939,123,4915,"Around the world, thousands of scientists have devoted their professional lives to studying the climate. Not centrally organised, they sometimes build temporary affiliations but they remain scientists throughout &#8211; that is, they are independent, constantly challenge each other and are committed to searching for truth through objective, independently verifiable evidence.
Overwhelmingly, this evidence has led to four conclusions. The first is that the world is warming. The global average temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees since 1850, with most of the increase occurring since 1950. The warming varies among decades because of natural fluctuations but the overall trend has been inexorably upward.
Warming is evident in other indicators, such as rising sea levels and reduced sea-ice and snow cover. Of these, the most important measure is the extra heat in the oceans, which is steadily rising. Claims that climate change has reversed since 1998 are misrepresentations of the full data.
The second conclusion is that the dominant cause of the warming since about 1950 is the increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases released by human activities, of which carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important.
This critical conclusion is based on several independent lines of evidence, including basic physics, studies of climate changes in both in the geological past and in the industrial era, and finally &#8211; but far from solely &#8211; from the predictions of climate models. Together, these provide an overwhelming case that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations cause warming, and that CO2 is the largest contributor to the current warming trend.
Other contributors include changes in the sun&#8217;s output associated with sunspots and solar flares, and volcanic dust. However, if these were solely responsible for temperature changes since 1850, the world should have cooled over the past half-century rather than warming at an increasing rate.
The third conclusion is that warming will increase in future, if emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases maintain their present paths. ""Business as usual"" scenarios for future emissions lead to likely global temperature increases of up to six degrees above present temperatures by 2100.
These are dramatic temperature increases, which would be accompanied by major disruptions to food supplies, river flows and water availability, significant and ongoing rises in sea level (of up to about a metre by 2100 and potentially metres over longer times), disease threats, disruptions to ecosystems including the extinction of many species, and social and geopolitical destabilisation.
The fourth conclusion is that climate change cannot be reversed for many centuries, because of the massive heat stores in the world&#8217;s oceans. Even if CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised today at their present levels, a further warming of at least 0.6 degrees would inevitably follow (on top of the 0.8 degrees observed since 1850) and sea-level rise would continue for centuries to millenniums.
These four conclusions have been known and agreed among thousands of independent climate scientists for more than a decade. However, new findings suggest that the situation is, if anything, more serious than the assessment of just a few years ago.
The heightened concern among climate scientists arises from a growing realisation that climate change can be accelerated beyond current predictions by reinforcing ""climate feedbacks"", which contribute to climate change and are accelerated as it occurs, thus causing climate change to feed on itself. When these feedbacks are sufficiently strong they become ""climate tipping points"" which can flip the climate into a new state with essentially no way to recover.
Several feedbacks are of immediate concern. Interactions between climate and the earth&#8217;s carbon cycle (the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, the land and the oceans) will act to accelerate climate change if sinks do not keep pace with emissions (as is already happening) and/or if previously stable carbon stores are released to the atmosphere under climate change, for example by the thawing of carbon-rich frozen soils.
Accelerated polar warming will cause loss of ice and a consequent darkening of the surface, leading to more heat absorption and faster warming. Atmospheric concentrations of aerosols (tiny particulates) are likely to decrease in future as nations improve air quality, leading to accelerated warming as the cooling effect of aerosols is reduced.
Oceans are becoming more acidic as a consequence of increased CO2 in the atmosphere. When CO2 concentrations exceed levels to be reached by 2035 under business-as-usual emissions scenarios, there will be severe disruptions to marine ecosystems (including the Great Barrier Reef and ocean food chains), which will endanger fisheries and weaken the uptake of CO2 by oceans.
Temperature rises of two to three degrees (or higher) carry a high risk of irreversible decay of the Greenland ice sheet from surface warming alone, leading to a sea level rise of up to about seven metres. Destabilisation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would cause a further few metres of sea-level rise.
A climate conference in Copenhagen in March concluded that societies were highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change, with poor nations and communities particularly at risk. Temperature rises above two degrees will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with and will increase the level of climate disruption through the rest of the century.
All of these concerns are firmly grounded in science. They have led the great majority of climate scientists to conclude (paraphrasing the summary of the Copenhagen conference) that rapid, sustained and effective emissions reductions are required to avoid &#8216;&#8216;dangerous climate change&#8217;&#8217;, regardless of how it is defined.
Higher future emissions increase the risk of crossing climate tipping points and they increase the likelihood that the long-term social and economic costs of both adaptation and mitigation will be higher.

 DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage
 (AP) - 4 hours ago
 WASHINGTON - Washington D.C.'s City Council has voted to legalize gay marriage in the nation's capital.
 Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill, which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council's 13 members. The final vote Tuesday was 11-2.
 The bill now goes to Congress, which has final say over the district's laws. Opponents say they'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it.
 Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters, who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine, New York and New Jersey.
 Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January.
 If Congress doesn't reject the bill, D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick's Day.The Associated Press: DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage"

Accordingly, the locus of the global cooling trend is Al Gore's house, with his home town recording the coldest July since 1877. This cooling is taken place even when we take measurements from land based thermometers positioned on concrete slabs and near air conditioning outlets.

Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design.
That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.
Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!
Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.
The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.
The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.
A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency.
The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all.
The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.
Origin of Species Chapter 13:
There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.
How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ?
On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.
Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.
Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.
But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars).
The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.
It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis.
","Originally Posted by IM2L844
I'm not assuming anything. In the arguements from homology Darwinists choose only examples that support what they assume to be evolutionary relationships while ignoring examples that do not support the TOE. This fact is well recognized. It is the very reason that the idea of convergent evolution was invented.
Walking-fish:
This is the old saw that homology involves a circular argument, which is usually stated as so: "" Common descent implies smilar structures and similar structures imply common descent"". The tacit assumption here is that similarity in structure is the only line of evidence for common descent. It is not. The evidence for common descent occurs prior to that for homolgy and can stand on its own.
Common descent is evidenced by examples of preadaptation &amp; exaptation in the fossil record, along with biogeography and embryology as well as genetics. Homologous traits must also appear in nested groupings, rather than at random. Taxonomists use terms like monophyletic &amp; paraphyletic to describe these nested groupings, and to distinguish them from the polyphyletic pattern seen with non-homologous similarity in structure.
OK!... Enough with the big words. Here's how it all pans out in practice. Let's put this all together to show how the wings of birds &amp; bats are homologous as forelimbs, but only analogous as wings. It isn't hard to see that nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates have four limbs, two notable exceptions being snakes &amp; whales which still have vestigial hindlimbs (whales having evolved from land dwelling mammals in the first place). A nested hierarchy of traits makes the common descent of forelimbs in bats &amp; birds obvious: vetebrae, notochord, amnion, radial indeterminate cleavage in the embryo etc... along with fossil evidence for common ancestry with reptiles.
But as for wings, there is no homology between birds &amp; bats. Beside fossil evidence for independent origins for these wings, and obviously different structures to the wings (involving 4 fingers for bats and no fingers for birds), there is the lack of evidence for nested grouping here. Bats are obviously more closely related to other mammals than they are to birds, so the possibility of common ancestry is ruled out. Wings are therefore a polyphyletic trait with respect to birds &amp; bats.
You can also use this reasoning to show how analogous structures shared by placental ant-eaters &amp; their marsupial counterparts in Australia show no signs of homology, because common ancestry is ruled out. That is , the placental ant-eaters have much more in common with other placentals than they do with the marsupial ant-eater. This is also confirmed by biogeography, since marsupials are almost exclusively, save for the oppossum, limmited to Australia. A close look at the anatomy of the skull will also show that similar structures for eating ants were derived independently. So, let me reinterate... COMMON ANCESTRY IMPLIES HOMOLOGY, and NOT the other way around.

None of the gays here are calling it a ""right"".

The actual ""right"" involved is the right to EQUAL PROTECTION. A constitutional right which mandates that people are free from unwarranted discrimination.

You've ignored the mounds of evidence and research which shows that gays are just as good parents as straights.
","typical strategy of the gay movement when challenged, resort to name calling ""trolls"" bigot etc, - project this form of abusive behavior on the adopted child who rebels against his gay 'carers' once he understands the reality of a heterosexual world.
Placing children with gay couples is unnecessary and harmful - if group homes are the only alternative then it is argued such environments are more healthy and indeed normal than farming kids out to gays

10,3,climate change,3.8,31630,35318,231,123,1827,"As far as the temperature 4000 yrs ago, it is generally accepted that they were higher. It is also generally accepted that CO2 levels were much higher, which was the cause of the increased global temperatures.
As far as the ice caps melting, they were much smaller then than they are now. Much more of the world was under water at the time.
I think it is pretty well established that increased CO2 levels will increase temperatures on earth. This has been tested on smaller scales in laboratories. There is nothing to suggest that the results of these experiments would not be scalable to the planet as a whole.
As far as the majority of o2 being generated by oceanic plants, it would be difficult or the environmentalists to talk people into ""adopting"" a patch of seaweed. Trees are big and beautiful. Seaweed is yucky and slimy,
There is a school of thought that says that the oceanic flora that provides the majority of our breathable oxygen is dying due to polution of the ocean. I haven't yet seen any hard numbers on this, so I personally am reserving judgement on this until more research is done.
I think that the dire predictions of ""the end of the world"" are a l little overstated. It is not the end of the world we are talking about, just the end of the world as we know it. This could allow self corection of the environment of a sort. Last time the global average temperature was 10 degrees higher than it is now, the eastern seaboard was underwater, as was the majority of California. See? The 2 larges polluting regions on the planet underwater. Nevada was a nice lake with all manner of aquatic life.
It was all still there, though. Just different.
","The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern, the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak. Projections show that instead of peaking, there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous.
Your lungs depend on partial pressure to oxygenate your blood. A change in percentage concentration will result in a change in partial pressure. This affects how we breathe. Projections show that with global warming there will be a vast increase in ocean cloud coverage, resulting in inhibited growth and photosynthesis of ocean plants, resulting in a lower yield of O2 on average.
The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole.
Ice is stilll ice at -30 or -40. I agree with your point that the earth will not flood, however, your justification is bogus. You also forget that with a temperature increase comes an increase in volume, its not the ice that people are worried about. Furthermore, certain currents are based on regional ocean temperatures and are responsible for the moderate climates in various areas (Britain for one).
Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)
And down south wear the majority of people live, they aren't. The people in Siberia won't be too happy when their food source dries up.
The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.
The temperature increase will hamper growth about as much as the CO2 increase will help it.
Looking at it from an economic perspective climate change on the scale that the greenhouse effect is causing will do nothing good.

11,5,evolution,4,203691,203746,10940,123,480,"Answers In Genesis has a list of arguments that creationists should never use. If there were a comparable list for evolutionists, I would probably put this classic text book example of evolution in the peppered moth on that list. It's not a bad example for illustration purposes, but the typical creationist response has been that this only shows ""microevolution"" within a species. They will then dismiss this as being irrelevant to ""macroevolution"" at higher taxons.
Have you ever read ""Icons of Evolution"" by Jonathon Wells? His attempts at dicrediting this study of moths by Kettlewell don't really refute the fact that natural selection does occur, but his criticisms are so often parroted on these discussion forums that you are in for a predictable onslaught whenever you bring it up. Natural selection really does happen. But showing how it occurs at the level of higher taxons is a bigger challenge and it is hard to meet that challenge by using this illustration of selection. I still think it's valuable as a means to explain natural selection in biology texts though.
","The moth was Biston betularia, the peppered moth. The first record of the observation of the dark morph was in 1848. As the lichens that grew on trees in industrialized areas of Great Britain died, and as the trees (and everything else) became covered with soot, the dark morphs became more and more numerous in industrialized areas. It took about 50 years for the frequency of dark morphs to go from essentially zero to about 99% of the population. It should be noted that the light morph never did disappear from populations away from the areas polluted by soot.
The marked release/capture predation experiments were done in 1953-1956 by Bernard Kettlewell, an ecologist, population geneticist and Physician from Oxford. His experiments were done before the campaign to clean up pollution of the later half of the 20th century. The campaign was so successful that the light morph is again more numerous all over Great Britain, comprising about 95% of the population.
I would add some very important specifications to that definition, as well as take one away. First, evolution is not just change, gradual or otherwise. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies of alleles in a population over time. That is to say, it is the genetic, heritable makeup of a population that undergoes the change. Moreover, while natural selection is extremely important, it is not the sole mechanism of evolution. Before natural selection can change the genetic makeup of a population, there must be a source of genetic diversity for selection to act upon. The methods by which that diversity arises are also mechanisms of evolution, i.e., those mechanisms cause changes in the allele frequency in the population.
Since it is so significant to evolutionary theory, it cannot be stressed enough that it is populations that evolve, not individuals, and that populations evolve by changes in the total genome of the population from generation to generation.
Or they postulate that an old book of mythology is an historical record. Anything, even observed reality, that conflicts with that mythology is rejected.
Yes. It is amazing. However, the change took place in about 50 years, and the change back to predominantly light moths also took about 50 years.
There is some discussion about the methodology employed by Kettlewell in his experiments. Michael Majerus reviewed these in his recent book. He concluded that Kettlewell did very well with the technology available to him, and that while the experiments may not have been perfect, the most logical conclusion is that the change in color of the peppered moth is an example of evolution by natural selection. Dr. Ken Miller does a better job of explaining so I'll just link his discussion. The Peppered Moth - An Update
And changing in about 50 years twice in the space of 150 years is even faster.
That may be true, but I suspect that the differential reproduction of a morph of a species of moth is too little evidence on which to base millions of years of human evolution.
OK. Quite simply, scientific theories aren't ever actually proved. There is the possibility that there exists other data that will cause a change. Besides, the color change is an observation - the fact - that is explained by the theory, i.e., differential reproductive success of certain morphs in a given environment.
True, but they won't argue that. They will argue that Kettlewell's experiments were faked. They will shout loudly about how he glued moths to trees and them watched as birds ate them just to see if they actually ate the more visible moths in greater numbers. They will also claim that peppered moths don't rest on the trunks of trees. Actually, they do sometimes. Creationists will never talk about the release/capture experiments.

Some do. I suppose it doesn't change the points made in a post, but it does show how much effort went in.

Today's society... I think that is more important than something that may have happened many years ago, right?

The effect of cytosine deamination on a random pool of amino acids and how it might facilitate evolution has been described. The optimal features of the genetic code are exploited by the vertebrate immune system by ""putting cytosine deamination to work"". Antibody diversification is crucial in limiting the frequency of environmentally acquired infections and thereby increasing the fitness of the organism. Initial diversification of antibodies is achieved by assembling variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments (V(D)J recombination) by non-homologous recombination. Further diversification is carried out by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and Class Switch Recombination. Central to the initiation to these diversification processes is the activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) protein. AID deaminates cytosine to uracil in single stranded DNA (ssDNA - arising during gene transcription) and is dependent on active gene transcription of the various antibody genes. The induced mutation is resolved by at least 4 pathways (Figure 1):
1) Copying of the base by high-fidelity polymerases during DNA replication.
2) Short-Patch Base Excision Repair (SP-BER) by uracil-DNA glycosylase removal and subsequent repair of the base.
3) Long-Patch Base Excision Repair (LP-BER)
4) Mismatch repair (MMR)
Link to big picture
http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1884
Figure 1: Activation induced cytosine deamination and the pathways involved in resolving the induced mutation. 1) Normal DNA replication results in a C:G&#8594;T:A transition. 2) Successful SP-BER resolves the mutation, however the recruitment of error-prone translesion polymerases results (e.g. REV1) in transversions (REV1; C:G&#8594;G:C) and transition. 3) LP-BER can also resolve the mutation, however recruitment of low-fidelity polymerases (e.g. Pol n) also causes transition and transversion mutations. 4) MMR repair can also resolve the mutation, however the recruitment of low-fidelity polymerases through this pathway is a major cause of A:T transitions.
AID causes somatic hypermutation and its activity is limited to the certain genetic regions of the immune system. When the system runs unchecked, mutations might be introduced into proto-oncogenes, resulting in possible cancerous growth. The system is controlled (Figure 2). The activity and gene expression of AID is controlled. The type of error-repair pathway and the subsequent recruitment of various low-fidelity polymerases determine the type of mutations after the repair process and these also seem to be controlled. Current research focuses on the mechanisms of control of downstream repair pathways and why this system is selectively targeted to the small region of antibody genes.
http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1886
Figure 2: Controlled variability of somatic hypermutation.
Thus, the immune system exploits the properties the genetic code for the purpose of controlled variability. This system is not only limited to vertabrate. Cytosine deamninases are found in bacteria as well. Error-prone repair systems are also present together with an optimal code.

","So the argument there seems to be that gun crime has been rising despite the strict gun laws of England. The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime:
""In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a:
""16% reduction in the use of handguns
9% reduction in robberies involving firearms
6% reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences
Despite these figures, the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98. And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55% in 2004-05 compared to the previous year. (Source: Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005)
""Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection.""
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-v...ime/gun-crime/
In addition, the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime:
""Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05, an increase of more than half (55%) from 2003/04....Ball-bearing (BB) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons....Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons, including an outright ban on the production, sale, and possession of BB guns, airguns, and replica guns....The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60% of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences. Nearly three quarters (72%) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident, set up to tackle gun crime within London?s black communities, were replicas, air guns, or starter pistols.""

I've asked repeatedly for an example of a mutation that beneficially alters phenotype and have yet to receive one. I don't deny mutations....I deny they play the role evos say they do. Likewise I do not deny the genetic code, I just deny it could have been built up the way darwinists say.
You're also asking if we reject physics?

The big bang is not a scientific fact -- it's simply an interpretation of the available evidence...but some people read the evidence in a completely different way and ackowledge that the big bang has some big holes in it. I don't accept ToE because I don't believe life is inherently accidental....and I don't believe variation arises randomly. Likewise there is no scientifically-proven cases of selection. Likewise there is no evidence in the fossil record of slow, gradual evolution from one species to another -- which has been the story for the past century. Likewise there are no half-ape/half-humans unearthed. Likewise there is no materialistic origin of life. I'll stop there, I guess.
","I don't recognize this version of physics, and I don't know where to begin to ask you to explain it. I'm going to take a stab in the dark, and begin with my notion of definable science. In physics, there are a number of foundational theories, including Newton's version of mechanics and gravity; the corpuscular and wave theories of light; Clerk-Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism; the luminiferous ether; statistical mechanics; thermodynamics; Special Relativity; General Relativity; Quantum Mechanics; The Standard Model; Quantum Supergravity; String Theory. That's not all, but it is sufficient for our discussion. Some of these theories are still held, some have been completely discarded, and some are currently in question at the margins. For example, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are fundamentally incompatible at the energies (=temperatures) of the Big Bang or the core of a Black Hole.
All of this, to me, is quite well-defined in several ways. Each theory can be clearly stated. The main evidence for and against each theory can be clearly stated. The history of each theory is well known. The history of physics, in the sense of which combination of theories is generally accepted, is also known. There are some notable errors and unprofitable side paths along the way, and there are brief transitions when the acceptance of one idea is going down, while another is rising to supplant it.

 [QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]
 
 Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should)."

My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.

It took at least a hundred years but sure enough DNA and genes were found. One of the hottest areas in science is genetics with hundreds of millions of dollars being invested This along with many other predictions makes evolution a good theory""
Really, you've hit the jackpot with this one, because www.talkorigins.com claims that the 'mechanism' is still unknown... at least how the 'mechanism' works to produce macroevolution. Perhaps you should write to them!
""An acquaintance who was an oil company geologist made this statement. ?Oil companies spend millions on evolutionary geologists to find oil and not one cent on creationist geologists. Again, predictions that make evolution a good theory.""
Yes, that is an amazing statement folks. The oil companies actively weed-out geologists who are creationists, because they've been looking for oil in all the wrong places (!) (at least that's what I assume this quote means).
""Where is evolution used outside of Biology, Geology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Embryology, and Genetics""
That's right, many of these sciences didn't exist before evolution (certainly not the first three!) (Ouch!)
""Evolutionary algorithms have been used for a number of years to design computer programs. One of the latest developments is designing electronic circuits using evolution. What is done is to start with a random design and create a population of these circuits. For the next generation, a random variation is introduced in a small subset of the population. Those that were most suitable for the job were selected and mated with some of the unmutated circuits. The next generation was still not near desired result but the process but the process continued. Each generation is closer to the desired result. After 5000 generations a working circuit was developed that even the designers did not understand how it worked. some of these circuit have received patents. You can read more about this at http://www.genetic-programming.com. As you can see the theory of evolution works in fields outside its primary field, this makes this a great theory.""
Can I restate this again... 'designing electronic circuits' ... design implies intelligence. And look, after 5000 generations we get what? A cyborg super-intelligence? Nope!
""The next time you hear someone say, ""When you see a computer (any manufactured item) you know it was designed"", you can now say it may have been designed using evolution.""
Yes, I can say that. I'll do that tomorrow at work! (ha!)

19,1,death penalty,-3.16,184337,184843,829,123,4760,"So far, I have read no pro-death penalty posts on this forum that have given adequate reasons to use it. There is no proof that it scares off potential murderers in society, and no other argument even makes sense. I posted a similar argument on a thread earlier, but decided it needs its own.
People always talk about how ""We need to think of John (the murdered), and have them put to death for John?s sake."" The dead don't seek revenge, and revenge can be nothing but meaningless to a person who is dead. Unless, of course, you can prove that revenge does have meaning for the dead, in which case our justice system might have reason to consider it. What these people are really doing is using the dead's name in order to get their own personal revenge. Anyone who uses the dead's name like this is defaming them, and this is absolutely wrong. If you want revenge, ask for it in your own name; don't be a coward. But, if you weren?t the one murdered, what right do you have to ask for revenge in your own name? You don?t. The only reason you have a right to ask for punishment at all is in the name of protecting society. We punish to ensure future safety by staving off future wrongdoings (again, the death penalty is no more effective than eternity in prison).
From the American people's perspective, what is just about spending more of their money putting a man to death than they would by simply removing him from society for the rest of his life? Both accomplish the same goal of total removal. If it has ever happened that a man convicted of murder was legally released, and killed yet again, one (or even a few) incident is laughable in the face of the number of innocent people put on death row.
The argument that convicted murderers might break free is also a joke. Justice is not put to use by acting under the assumption that its dictates will not be followed through. Similarly, we could assume anything about anyone we ever punished at all. Were I a teacher, I could assume that the child I sent to the corner was going to leave early, and thus escort him straight to the principle's office, just to be prudent. Such reasoning allows virtually any punishment to be extended ad infinitum because the punished might fall out of line with their punishment at any time.
Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a ?perfect? judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn?t punish in order to ?get revenge.? (In addition, this argument can be flipped and used against the argument that prisoners might escape: ""But that's a problem with prison security!"" Or against the inmate release argument: ""But that's a problem with releasing life-in-prison muderers, not with the punishment itself if it were properly used!"")
But the worst part of it all is this ""machismo"" aura that many pro-death penalty citizens try to emulate. ""They killed so and so, therefore stick it to 'em and let 'em burn! I hope he dies slow, and wets himself, too!!"" You think this is manly? The biggest laugh of the whole death penalty argument is that the whole thing is upheld by immature cowards who don't appear to know what it is to be a real man (or woman) in the least.
","Jim, before posting all this garbage on why innocent people are not sentenced to death, maybe you should read this thread first.
And again:
The ""statistics"" that you cite are some of the biggest loads of garbage I've ever heard of. They are nothing more than projected guesses made to put the death penalty in a positive light. In addition, in case you haven't figured it out at this stage in your life, statistics are almost always garbage. Take a few stat classes and you will see how deceptively wrong they can be. The biggest problem with statistics is that it inherently assumes causality -- all the time. It must do so in order to appear to make sense (without this link, statistics would be meaningless). For example, here is a statistic I just ran into (http://btobsearch.barnesandnoble.com...68957912&amp;itm=2) ""Want to extend your life? Start flossing! Statistics show that people who floss daily and visit a dentist and dental hygienist every six months live almost six and a half years longer than the Unflossed."" The problem with this is that the statistic is inherently flawed, because the type of people who floss also tend to be the types of people who have many other healthy habits that cause them to live longer. The statistic tricks us into assuming a false causality. The sooner you understand this and start getting away from statistics (particularly fake, projected statistics that are used on extremely large populations), the sooner you will not be fooled into believing some very tricky lies.
If you want to discuss projected statistics over large populations, I?d be happy to continue, as I happen to be knowledgeable in the field.
Well, why do you support it?

19,2,gay marriage,3.8,349047,349049,10447,123,456,"Background Ad Rebuttal
?The Real Truth Behind the Fake Ad?
The general argument of the ad is that the push for marriage equality isn?t just about rights for same-sex couples, it?s about imposing contrary values on people of faith. The examples they cite in the ad are:
(1) A California doctor who must choose between her faith and her job
(2) A member of New Jersey church group which is punished by the state because they can?t support same-sex marriage
(3) A Massachusetts parent who stands by helpless while the state teaches her son that gay marriage is okay
The facts indicate that (1) refers to the Benitez decision in California, determining that a doctor cannot violate California anti-discrimination law by refusing to treat a lesbian based on religious belief, (2) refers to the Ocean Grove, New Jersey Methodist pavilion that was open to the general public for events but refused access for civil union ceremonies (and was fined by the state for doing so) and (3) refers to the Parker decision in Massachusetts, where parents unsuccessfully sought to end public school discussions of family diversity, including of same-sex couples.
All three examples involve religious people who enter the public sphere, but don?t want to abide by the general non-discriminatory rules everyone else does. Both (1) and (2) are really about state laws against sexual orientation discrimination, rather than specifically about marriage. And (3) is about two pairs of religious parents trying to impose their beliefs on all children in public schools.
The real facts of each case are:
The California doctor entered a profession that promises to ?first, do no harm? and the law requires her to treat a patient in need ? gay or straight, Christian or Muslim ? regardless of her religious beliefs. The law does not, and cannot, dictate her faith ? it can only insist that she follow her oath as a medical professional.
The New Jersey church group runs, and profits from, a beachside pavilion that it rents out to the general public for all manner of occasions ?concerts, debates and even Civil War reenactments? but balks at permitting couples to hold civil union ceremonies there. The law does not challenge the church organization?s beliefs about homosexuality ? it merely requires that a pavilion that had been open to all for years comply with laws protecting everyone from discrimination, including gays and lesbians.
The Massachusetts parent disagrees with an aspect of her son?s public education, a discussion of the many different kinds of families he will likely encounter in life, including gay and lesbian couples. The law does not stop her from disagreeing, from teaching him consistently with her differing beliefs at home, or even educating her child in a setting that is more in line with her faith traditions. But it does not allow any one parent to dictate the curriculum for all students based on her family?s religious traditions.
HRC | Human Rights Campaign Exposes National Organization for Marriage?s Fake Ad for Fake Problems
","Actually, no, my understanding is that in most states the law doesn't require this at all. Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath, but it's not a legally binding oath. Doctors may be subject to personal lawsuits, but that's not the same thing.
Also, the fact the church you mentioned owns a ""beachside pavillion"" has nothing to do with much of anything. If the church truly owns it, they can refuse any ceremony they want. That it has been ""open to all for years"" carries no weight whatsoever. It is church property--which is essentially the same as a church saying it doesn't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse. Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada, but not in the US.
Given these matters, I'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to.

","Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws.
